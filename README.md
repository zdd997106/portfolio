## 📌 About This Project  

This portfolio website is built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript** and deployed on **Vercel** for seamless hosting and performance.  
All content on the website is provided by [**ZPanel**](https://github.com/zdd997106/zpanel), another side project of mine, via a third-party API.  
The API supports a **bypass-app-key** in the request header, allowing access to resources without the usual authorization process.
